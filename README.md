# Covid-19-Patient-Monitoring-System

A Project to remotely monitor the health conditions of a Covid-19 infected patient
As the COVID-19 Pandemic has hit the world in very severe manner. It has drastically changed the
formulations in the field of Education, Governance, and even some positive changes in environment.
The mainly affected field is the healthcare. Front line workers have also been affected by the pandemic.
Even to reduce the further spread of the pandemic WHO has specified the protocols which prominently
includes SOCIAL DISTANCING. Even during the treatment of the patients doctor has to use the PPE
Kit which is quite expensive and hence the hospital bill goes up. So in order to reduce the cost and
ensure the guidelines of WHO we have developed the project.

# **OBJECTIVES**:
The objective of this idea is to remotely monitor the health conditions of the COVID-19 Patients and
notify the hospital staff. This can be helpful for the government too so that it can keep track of the
home quarantined patients too. This project uses the Arduino and the WiFi module named ESP32. The
Project helps to know the Blood oxygen level, Pulse rate and body temperature of the COVID-19
Patient. By monitoring the blood oxygen level and pulse rate doctor can control the oxygen flow in the
patients ventilator so that adequate amount os oxygen is supplied to the patient.

# *IMPLEMENTATION*:
The idea will be implemented in the affordable and easily usable model. The sensors will be embedded
on a band. the band will be worn by the patient. The sensors will sense the real time data from the
patient and send it to the cloud. The data will be accessed directly from the server through the
developed application. The doctor can also monitor the flow of oxygen in the patients ventilator
through the application.

# *APPLICATIONS*:
-This idea can be used during the time of pandemic.

-This idea can be used by the Government inorder to track the patients who got infected by the COVID
19 and who are undergoing home quarantine.

-Regularly the doctor or nurse can get the notification through the app when the certain levelof
parameters goes down of the threshold level.
